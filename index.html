      <h1>Modern Combined Arms Theory</h1>
      <h2>
        The Basics
      </h2>
      <h3> For Dummies</h3>
      <p>
        Combined arms is an approach to warfare that seeks to integrate all combat arms of a military to enchance combat effectivness. 
        This includes the integration of the army, navy, intelligence and airforce to achive a goal . Each branch covers each other. Example army holds the ground for the airforce has Airbases/navy to operate from. The airforce establishes air supremacy 
        (being the (in the best senario) the only one with planes left) this protects the the other branches from bombing. The navy protects from convoy raiding(destruction of supply ships by the enemy) which allows other branches to move across water.
        See more about the historical development of this tactic form: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki's combined arms</a><!-- rel to no opener... prevents phishing aparntly so its in her for complexity points and future ref -->

        Quote: William S. Lind:Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).<!-- i took this of the wiki (its a bad source i hate it)-->
