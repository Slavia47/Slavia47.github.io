        Infantry
      </h3>
      <p>
        The role of infantry in modern combat comprize of being the primary "protector" in the combined arms model. This is due to their cheap equipment meaning the cost of lots of atrition can be absorbed.
        Additional therefor they are plentiful and compromise most of the military(normaly). Furthermore they are a necessity as they fufill multiple niches in the military that the others cant.
        The most crutial of these at the operational level is Urban warfare. This is due to the plentiful vertical elevation that can be found this makes it difficult for any other part of the military to fight 
        in. <!-- i could explain thurther but i could be stuck here for hours why buildings are so good for inf and how urban warfare works but heres a wiki article again--> for more information aboput urban warfare see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_warfare"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki's urban warfare</a> or see YT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-H6p9SsATk&ab_channel=Task%26Purpose"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Task & Pourpose</a><!-- NGL a lot of my knowledge comes from him :)-->
