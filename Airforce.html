      <h3>
        Planes
      </h3>
      <p>
        Modern fighter jets are designed primerily to be multirole meaning the same jet can perform missions for: air supremacy, CAS, SEAD and DEAD.
        This is done though ataching the weapons on external or internal pylons. Planes role include first insuring they can contest the airspace by shoting down enemy fighters. After they destroy enought opfor fighters
        air supremacy is established. This means that they can focus on helping the ground targets but first the must ensure thair safty in doing so. This is where SEAD&DEAD comes in used to get rid off enemy air defence.
        Then the airfoce can focus on CAS bombing the enemy ground units. There Is also the interception mission for when recources are limited due to factores like lack of fuel or planes. This is where planes sprtie out
        selectivly to destroy high value or easy missions primarily to protect ground troops from bombing. Air comand is usualy conservative of the with its resources due expense. Therefor
        This is the steps followed to use airpower effectivly.

      <h3>
        Helicopters
      </h3>
      <p>
        <!-- Hellicopter Helicopter Money case  Money case-->
        There are multipe types and roles. A highly versitile platform capable of fast manuver and can hold similar ordinence to planes however unlike planes they can loiter around the battlefild and provide continous
        support. However they suffer severly as soon as they encounter any air defence. Helicopters in combined arms are primarily for fast troop transport. However there are also attack helicopters best used when the 
        enemy has left their Air defence onion. Helis can devestate an armoured column without air defence easily when equipted with ATGMs and rockets.
