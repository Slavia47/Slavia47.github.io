        Submerines<!-- their first coz i lov em & small to big-->
      </h3>
      <h4>
        convential submerines( torpedo tubes)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Have only two goals. Primarily sink enemy logistics convoys or sink any enemy warship that gets in its way.
      </p>
      <h4>
        missile submerines
      </h4>
      <p>
        Used to stealthily sneak up to coast and bombard costal instalations used to destroy ships in harbour or make the harbour unusable shrinking the enemys navl range. They can also be equiped with nukes 
        and quickly launched in a first strike on a nation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        corvette
      </h3>
      <p><!--wiki i know least about the navy-->
        Primarily small ship for convoy escort and normaly equiped with anti submerine equipment such as depth charges.
      </p>
      <h3>
        destroyer
      </h3>
      <p>
        Is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy, or battle group and defend them against powerful short-range attackers
      </p>
      <h3>
        Cruiser
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ever since the retirment of the battleships they are the largest after the aircraft carrier. Therfore the heviest armed with multipe anti ship missiles missle and air defence and conventional guns.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Aircraft carrier
      </h3>
      <p>
        Used to ferry and control aircraft. They will deploy airwings with anti ship missiles and torpedos. The advantage here is that the navl strikeforce can stay out of range and safly engage and destroy the enemy 
        ships. However a risk is incured with using Aircraft carriers that is being costs. They cost a lot in maintanence and if one gets destroyed it takes all the planes with them. Heres some estimates:
        Nimitz-class aircraft carrier cost 8.5 (10.1 in 2021)billion dollars and contains 85-90 aircraft and the cost of a f35 is 79.2 million a piece.Therefor they always have an escort group to protect them as it would 
        be 'unpleasent' for one to get sunk...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saCdvAp5cow&t=122s&ab_channel=RealEngineering"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
